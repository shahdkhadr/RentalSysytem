# Week 8 - From 16/11/2024 to 21/11/2024 ( Task Given By Trainer )

## Task Content

انا بدي ابعث ريكويست على الداتابيس, يرجعلي فيرجن للسبرينغ اللي احنا شغالين عليها ونعمل فلتر على الريكويست اللي بتنبعث على الداتابيس ما يشوفها الا حدا محدد 

- in case the admin want to know some app metrics and meta data of system running app, we don't want to reveal to anyone that the app is monitoring the info should be protected,  I want from you to have 1- user-defined actuator func --> provide the spring version ---> /monitoring/springVersion 2- write a custom springboot security func to protect the /monitoring/springVersion 3- all the defaault and system provided actuator endpoints should be disabled 4- allow only the custom actuator 5- the rest of all the apis should works without authentication  .
- the endpoint should be stateless and CSRF need to be disabled !
    - GET --> /monitoring/springVersion (Actuator endpoint)
        - Must require basic HTTP authentication to access.
        
        ```jsx
        Should return the Spring version used in this app as a response string.
        Response example:
        json
        {
        "version": "6.0.9.RELEASE"
        }
        ```
        
    - GET /app/vehicle (REST endpoint)
        - Should be accessible without authentication.
        - Should return the response body: "vehicle".
        - Example Request and Response:
        Request:
        - GET /monitoring/springVersion
        
        ```jsx
        
        Header: Authorization: "Basic admin:admin"
        Response Code: 200
        Response Body:
        {
        "version": "6.0.9.RELEASE"
        }
        ```
        
- Notes:
For any authenticated request, the header should include Authorization: Basic (encoded username:password). The username and password values are already configured in the SpringSecurityConfig class.
Task:
Implement the SpringVersionActuator and SpringSecurityConfig classes to meet the requirement
